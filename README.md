# Automatidata

## About this project
Automatidata works with its clients to transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions, such as performance dashboards, customer-facing tools, strategic business insights, and more. They specialize in identifying a client’s business needs and utilizing their data to meet those business needs. 

Automatidata is consulting for the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). New York City TLC is an agency responsible for licensing and regulating New York City's taxi cabs and for-hire vehicles. The agency has partnered with Automatidata to develop a regression model that helps estimate taxi fares before the ride, based on data that TLC has gathered. 

The TLC data comes from over 200,000 taxi and limousine licensees, making approximately one million combined trips per day.

## Dataset
The dataset you will be working with is the "Online Retail" dataset. It contains transactional data of an online retail store from 2010 to 2011. The dataset is available as a .xlsx file named `Online Retail.xlsx`. This data file is already included in the Coursera Jupyter Notebook environment, however if you are working off-platform it can also be downloaded [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00352/Online%20Retail.xlsx).

The dataset contains the following columns:

- InvoiceNo: Invoice number of the transaction
- StockCode: Unique code of the product
- Description: Description of the product
- Quantity: Quantity of the product in the transaction
- InvoiceDate: Date and time of the transaction
- UnitPrice: Unit price of the product
- CustomerID: Unique identifier of the customer
- Country: Country where the transaction occurred

## Tasks
1. Build a dataframe for the TLC data
2. Organize the data for the process of exploratory data analysis and gather descriptive statistics
3. Conduct exploratory data analysis on data for the TLC project
4. Create plots to visualize relationships between relevant variables using Tableau
5. Investigate TLC’s dataset to determine which hypothesis testing method best serves the data and the TLC project and conduct hypothesis testing for the TLC data
6. Determine the correct modeling approach and build a regression model for the TLC data
7. Finish checking model assumptions, evaluate the model, and interpret model results
8. Perform feature engineering, build a machine learning model for TLC, and evaluate the model, and summarize findings
